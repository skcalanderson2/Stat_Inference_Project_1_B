The data consists of measurements of the mean length of the odontoblast cells harvested from the incisor teeth of a population of 60 guinea pigs. These animals were divided into 6 groups of 10 and consistently fed a diet with one of 6 Vitamin C supplement regimes for a period of 42 days. The Vitamin C was administered either in the form of Orange Juice (OJ) or chemically pure Vitamin C in aqueous solution (VC). Each animal received the same daily dosage of Vitamin C (either 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 milligrams) consistently. Since each combination of supplement type and dosage was given to 10 animals this required a total of 60 animals for the study. After 42 days, the animals were euthanized, their incisor teeth were harvested and subject to analysis via optical microscopy to determine the length (in microns) of the odontoblast cells (the layer between the pulp and the dentine). The ToothGrowth data set therefore consists of 60 observations of the 3 variables - mean length of odontoblasts (microns), supplement type (OJ or VC) and Vitamin C dosage (milligrams/day).
